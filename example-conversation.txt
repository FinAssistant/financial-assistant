Hello, I am Matteo a 39 yrs old Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA. I am married and I have a one year old kid. I am planning to save for a 5 months long trip.

Letting you know more about me: I worked at Intel for 3 years and I was let go in July. My wife Giulia works in a school and is taking a 6 months leave of absence starting in October.

We do have some investments already, but I would like to rebalance them to have a more conservative approach that gives us a steady income while we are traveling.
