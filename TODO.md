# TODOs

This is a list of issues that I am tracking down in the system that will eventually need to be addressed

## UI

1. If a user send a message to the chatbot and receives a 401, they should be redirected to login (this actually applies to all API calls)

## API

### Auth

1. Investigate why users are not persisted
