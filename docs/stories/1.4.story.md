## Story Context

### Existing System Integration
- **Integrates with**: Authenticated user sessions (Stories 1.1-1.2), Navigation layout (Story 1.3)
- **Technology**: React + AI-SDK for frontend streaming, FastAPI + LangGraph for backend orchestration  
- **Follows pattern**: RTK Query API pattern, Styled Components UI pattern, Protected routes with AuthGuard
- **Touch points**: Redux auth state, Navigation menu, Backend conversation API

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.1-1.3.story.md completion notes]
- Authentication system fully operational with JWT tokens and protected routes
- Redux Toolkit store configured with auth state and RTK Query
- Professional UI foundation established with responsive navigation and Styled Components
- Component testing patterns established with Jest + Testing Library

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **AI Framework**: LangGraph 0.0.x for multi-agent conversation orchestration
- **Frontend AI**: AI-SDK 2.2.x for React AI conversation interface with streaming
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit 1.9.x with RTK Query for API state management
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI 0.104.x with async support for streaming responses
- **UI Components**: Styled Components 6.1.x following established design patterns

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Backend AI modules**: `backend/app/ai/`
  - `langgraph_config.py` - LangGraph configuration
  - `orchestrator.py` - Orchestrator Agent implementation
- **Backend API routes**: `backend/app/routers/conversation.py`
- **Frontend chat components**: `frontend/src/components/chat/`
  - `ChatInterface/` - Main chat container
  - `MessageInput/` - User input component  
  - `MessageList/` - Message display component
- **Frontend pages**: `frontend/src/pages/ChatPage/`
- **Redux state**: `frontend/src/store/slices/conversationSlice.ts`
- **API integration**: `frontend/src/store/api/conversationApi.ts`

### Integration Patterns
[Source: docs/stories/1.2.story.md patterns]
- **API Pattern**: Follow RTK Query baseQuery with JWT token headers from auth implementation
- **State Pattern**: Follow Redux Toolkit slice patterns with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Component Pattern**: Follow Styled Components with theme integration from UI foundation
- **Route Pattern**: Follow protected route pattern with AuthGuard from navigation implementation

### LangGraph Architecture Foundation
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, technical-assumptions.md]
- **Simple Graph**: Single Orchestrator node that processes messages and returns responses
- **Future Extensibility**: Graph structure ready for specialized agents (Onboarding, Spending, etc.)
- **Memory**: Basic in-memory conversation state, no persistence required for POC
- **Agent Capabilities**: Echo user messages with acknowledgment, prepare for future agent routing

### AI-SDK Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Streaming Support**: Use AI-SDK useChat hook for real-time response streaming
- **API Compatibility**: Backend `/conversation/send` endpoint compatible with AI-SDK format
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of AI service failures and network issues
- **Loading States**: Proper loading and thinking indicators during agent processing

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **API Routes**: Use kebab-case (`/conversation/send`)
- **React Components**: Use PascalCase (`ChatInterface`, `MessageInput`, `MessageList`)
- **Python Classes**: Use PascalCase (`OrchestratorAgent`)
- **State Management**: Follow Redux patterns, never mutate state directly
- **AI Integration**: Always use AI-SDK for streaming, never direct API calls

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Backend Tests**: FastAPI async testing for conversation endpoints
- **Frontend Tests**: Component tests for chat interface interactions
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end chat flow from input to response
- **State Tests**: Redux slice testing for conversation state management
- **AI Tests**: Mock LangGraph responses for predictable testing

### Security and Performance
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]
- **Authentication**: All conversation endpoints protected with JWT authentication
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user messages before processing
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limiting to prevent conversation abuse
- **Streaming Performance**: Optimize for real-time message streaming
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of AI service failures

## Technical Notes

### Integration Approach
Chat component integrates into existing Layout with Navigation, uses AuthGuard protection, connects via RTK Query to FastAPI conversation endpoint that streams responses through AI-SDK.

### Existing Pattern Reference
- Follow RTK Query pattern from `frontend/src/store/api/authApi.ts`
- Use Styled Components pattern from `frontend/src/components/layout/` components
- Follow protected route pattern from existing AuthGuard implementation

### Key Constraints
- Keep Orchestrator Agent simple (basic echo/acknowledgment responses)
- Focus on UI/backend connection infrastructure, not complex AI logic
- Maintain existing authentication and navigation functionality unchanged
- Follow established component and state management patterns

## Risk and Compatibility Check

### Minimal Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk**: AI-SDK streaming integration complexity or LangGraph setup issues
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple echo responses, add streaming incrementally
- **Rollback**: Chat feature can be disabled via navigation, no data persistence risk

### Compatibility Verification
- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs (new endpoints only)
- [x] No database changes (in-memory conversation state)
- [x] UI changes follow existing Styled Components design patterns  
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (separate chat route and optional feature)

## Validation Checklist

### Scope Validation
- [x] Story can be completed in one focused development session (basic foundation)
- [x] Integration approach is straightforward (follows existing RTK Query + Auth patterns)
- [x] Follows existing patterns exactly (Styled Components, Redux, protected routes)
- [x] No complex design or architecture work required (basic chat interface)

### Clarity Check
- [x] Story requirements are unambiguous (basic chat with simple AI responses)
- [x] Integration points are clearly specified (Auth, Navigation, Redux, LangGraph)
- [x] Success criteria are testable (component tests, API tests, integration tests)
- [x] Rollback approach is simple (disable chat navigation item)
