# Story 1.4.1: Implement True Server-Sent Events Streaming for AI Conversations

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** user interacting with the AI financial assistant,  
**I want** to see AI responses stream in real-time as they are generated,  
**so that** I get immediate feedback and don't have to wait for the complete response before seeing any output.

## Story Context

**Current Issue:** The `/conversation/send` endpoint simulates streaming by formatting a complete AI response in SSE format, but all data is generated at once after the AI processing completes. This creates a false streaming experience.

**Technical Problem:** 
- Orchestrator blocks until complete response is ready (`orchestrator.process_message()`)
- Stream generator yields pre-generated complete response in chunks
- No actual real-time streaming occurs

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. AI responses stream incrementally as tokens are generated by the language model
2. Users see partial responses appearing in real-time during AI processing
3. Streaming maintains AI-SDK v5 compatibility with proper event types
4. Stream properly terminates with `[DONE]` event after complete response

**Technical Requirements:**
5. Implement async generator pattern for true streaming in orchestrator
6. LangGraph configuration updated to support streaming responses
7. FastAPI endpoint streams data as it becomes available (not batched)
8. Maintain existing AI-SDK event format: `start`, `text-start`, `text-delta`, `text-end`

**Performance Requirements:**
9. First token latency reduced compared to current implementation
10. Stream chunks sent immediately when available (no buffering)
11. Graceful handling of streaming interruptions or errors

**Backward Compatibility:**
12. Non-streaming endpoint `/conversation/message` continues to work unchanged
13. Existing AI-SDK headers and response format maintained
14. Frontend integration remains compatible with current implementation

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Update Orchestrator for Streaming** (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Modify `OrchestratorAgent.process_message()` to return async generator
  - [ ] Create new `stream_message()` method that yields response chunks
  - [ ] Update LangGraph configuration to enable streaming mode
  - [ ] Handle streaming errors and connection interruptions

- [ ] **Implement True SSE in Conversation Router** (AC: 1, 3, 7)
  - [ ] Replace `generate_stream()` with real async streaming generator
  - [ ] Yield `text-delta` events as chunks arrive from orchestrator
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling for stream interruptions
  - [ ] Add stream timeout and connection monitoring

- [ ] **Testing and Validation** (AC: 9, 10, 11)
  - [ ] Create streaming response time benchmarks
  - [ ] Test stream interruption and error scenarios
  - [ ] Validate AI-SDK event sequence and timing

- [ ] **Backward Compatibility Verification** (AC: 12, 13, 14)
  - [ ] Ensure non-streaming endpoint unchanged
  - [ ] Verify frontend continues working with new streaming
  - [ ] Run regression tests on existing conversation functionality

## Dev Notes

**Relevant Source Tree:**
- `backend/app/routers/conversation.py:65-145` - Current streaming endpoint
- `backend/app/ai/orchestrator.py` - OrchestratorAgent implementation
- `backend/app/ai/langgraph_config.py` - LangGraph configuration
- `frontend/src/components/chat/ChatInterface/index.tsx` - AI-SDK integration

**Current Implementation Analysis:**
- Line 100: `orchestrator.process_message()` blocks completely
- Lines 114-133: `generate_stream()` creates fake stream from complete response
- Lines 120-133: SSE format is correct, but data is pre-generated

**Required Changes:**
1. **Orchestrator Layer:** Convert to async generator pattern
2. **LangGraph Config:** Enable streaming with `stream_mode="values"`
3. **FastAPI Endpoint:** True async iteration over orchestrator stream
4. **Error Handling:** Graceful stream termination on failures

**Technical Reference:**
- LangGraph streaming: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/streaming/
- FastAPI StreamingResponse: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#streamingresponse
- AI-SDK event types: `start`, `text-start`, `text-delta`, `text-end`, termination

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- Location: `backend/tests/test_conversation_streaming.py`
- Framework: pytest with httpx AsyncClient
- Patterns: Async streaming response validation
- Requirements: Real-time latency measurement, stream event sequence verification

**Specific Tests Needed:**
- Stream timing validation (first token < 2s)
- Event sequence correctness
- Stream interruption handling
- Concurrent stream handling
