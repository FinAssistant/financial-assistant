### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Layout components: `frontend/src/components/layout/`
  - `Layout/` - Main responsive layout wrapper
  - `Header/` - Already exists, needs navigation integration  
  - `Navigation/` - New navigation menu component
- Common components: `frontend/src/components/common/`
  - `LoadingSpinner/` - Loading state component
  - `ErrorBoundary/` - Error boundary wrapper
  - `ErrorMessage/` - Error display component
- Global styles: `frontend/src/styles/`
  - `GlobalStyles.ts` - Base styling and reset
  - `theme.ts` - Design system and theme configuration
- Type definitions: `frontend/src/types/navigation.ts`

### Visual Design System
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]
- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary: #2563eb (Call-to-action buttons, navigation highlights)
  - Success: #16a34a (Positive states, confirmations)
  - Warning: #ca8a04 (Cautions, pending states)
  - Error: #dc2626 (Errors, critical alerts)
  - Neutral: #64748b (Text, borders, secondary elements)
- **Typography**:
  - Primary Font: Inter (clean, professional, excellent readability)
  - H1: 32px, weight 600, line-height 1.2
  - H2: 24px, weight 600, line-height 1.3  
  - Body: 16px, weight 400, line-height 1.5
- **Iconography**: Lucide React with 24px standard size, 16px for inline elements
- **Spacing**: 8px base unit system (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)

### Responsive Design Strategy  
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]
- **Breakpoints**:
  - Mobile: 320px - 767px (Single column, stacked components)
  - Tablet: 768px - 1023px (Two-column with priority content on left)
  - Desktop: 1024px - 1439px (Multi-column dashboard with sidebar navigation)
  - Large: 1440px+ (Large monitor optimization)
- **Navigation Patterns**:
  - Mobile: Hamburger menu with full-screen overlay
  - Tablet: Horizontal navigation with condensed items
  - Desktop: Sidebar navigation with expanded menu items

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]
```typescript
// Layout component structure
interface LayoutProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  showNavigation?: boolean;
  loading?: boolean;
  error?: string | null;
}

// Navigation component structure  
interface NavigationItem {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  path: string;
  icon: LucideIcon;
  requiresAuth: boolean;
  children?: NavigationItem[];
}
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Components**: PascalCase (`Layout.tsx`, `Navigation.tsx`, `LoadingSpinner.tsx`)
- **Type Definitions**: Define interfaces in `frontend/src/types/`
- **State Updates**: Use proper Redux patterns, never mutate state directly
- **Environment Variables**: Access through config objects only
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error boundaries and user-friendly messaging

### Integration with Authentication
[Source: docs/stories/1.2.story.md#completion-notes]
- AuthGuard component already implemented for route protection
- Header component exists with authentication state integration
- Redux authSlice provides authentication state for conditional navigation
- JWT token management operational for protected route access

### Trust-Building Design Elements  
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]
- **Professional Credibility**: Clean, uncluttered layouts with consistent typography
- **Security Indicators**: Clear visual hierarchy with professional color usage
- **Transparency Features**: Obvious navigation paths and clear information architecture
- **Consistent Branding**: Inter font family and financial-appropriate color palette

## Testing

### Test File Locations
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Component tests: `frontend/src/components/layout/__tests__/`
- Common component tests: `frontend/src/components/common/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `frontend/src/tests/integration/`

### Testing Standards
- **Frontend**: Jest + @testing-library/react for component testing
- **Patterns**: Provider wrapper for Redux store in tests
- **Coverage**: Focus on user interactions, responsive behavior, accessibility
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for navigation flows

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Use Provider wrapper for Redux store context in all component tests
- Test responsive behavior with resize event simulation
- Validate accessibility with axe-core integration
- Test error boundary behavior with intentional error triggering

### Specific Testing Requirements
**Testing is embedded in each task above, following the testing pyramid pattern:**

- **Component Tests** (Tasks 1-2): Layout responsiveness, navigation interactions, route integration
- **Visual Tests** (Task 3): Theme consistency, design system implementation, color usage
- **Error Handling Tests** (Task 4): Error boundaries, loading states, recovery mechanisms  
- **Responsive Tests** (Task 5): Breakpoint behavior, mobile navigation, touch interactions
- **Integration Tests** (Task 6): Authentication state integration, protected navigation, user flows

**All tests must be runnable via `scripts/run-tests.sh` and follow established patterns from Stories 1.1-1.2.**
