# Story 1.5: MCP Server Foundation

## User Story

**As a** system architect,  
**I want** a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integrated into the existing FastAPI backend,  
**So that** multiple AI agents can access shared tools and data sources through a standardized interface while maintaining the current application architecture.

## Status: üîÑ Ready for Review

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing FastAPI application (`backend/app/main.py`)
- Technology: FastAPI, Python 3.11+, Docker containerization
- Follows pattern: Existing lifespan management and endpoint mounting patterns
- Touch points: Application startup/shutdown, environment configuration, test automation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. MCP server runs as integrated component within existing FastAPI application
2. AI agents can discover and execute tools via standardized MCP protocol at `/mcp` endpoint
3. Health monitoring tools provide server status and uptime information

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing FastAPI endpoints (`/api/*`, `/health`) continue to work unchanged
5. New MCP functionality follows existing environment configuration pattern (MCP_ prefix)
6. Integration with existing Docker containerization maintains current deployment approach

**Quality Requirements:**
7. MCP server functionality is covered by both unit and integration tests
8. Test automation includes MCP client verification using langchain-mcp-adapters
9. No regression in existing FastAPI functionality verified through test suite

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:** FastMCP server mounted at `/mcp` endpoint within existing FastAPI application using `app.mount()` pattern

**Existing Pattern Reference:** Follows established FastAPI lifespan management and environment configuration patterns used throughout the application

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Server Framework:** FastMCP v2.12.0 with `@mcp.tool` decorators
- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP with stateless_http=True for langchain-mcp-adapters compatibility  
- **Lifecycle Management:** Combined lifespan pattern integrating FastAPI + FastMCP startup/shutdown
- **Configuration:** MCP_ prefixed environment variables following existing conventions
- **Testing:** Unit tests for business logic + integration tests with real MCP client

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met - MCP server integrated and running
- [x] Integration requirements verified - Existing FastAPI functionality unchanged
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested - All tests pass
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards - Environment config, lifespan management
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new) - Unit tests + integration test with langchain-mcp-adapters
- [x] Documentation updated - Story documentation and testing instructions included

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** MCP server integration could interfere with existing FastAPI application startup/shutdown lifecycle

**Mitigation:** Used combined lifespan pattern that properly coordinates FastAPI and FastMCP lifecycles, ensuring both start and stop correctly together

**Rollback:** Remove MCP mount point and revert to previous FastAPI configuration - no database changes or breaking API modifications made

## Compatibility Verification

- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs - All existing `/api/*` endpoints unchanged  
- [x] Database changes are additive only - No database modifications required for MCP integration
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns - No frontend changes required
- [x] Performance impact is negligible - MCP server runs in same process, minimal overhead

## Technical Architecture

```
FastAPI Application (Single Process)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /api/* (Existing REST endpoints) ‚Üê Unchanged
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /health (FastAPI health check) ‚Üê Unchanged  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /mcp (FastMCP server) ‚Üê NEW: MCP Protocol Integration
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tool execution (mcp_health_check, echo, get_current_time) 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Plaid tools (create_link_token, get_accounts - placeholders)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Compatible with langchain-mcp-adapters
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /static (React frontend) ‚Üê Unchanged
```

## Business Value Delivered

‚úÖ **AI Agent Platform Ready**: System can now support multiple AI agents accessing shared tools through standardized MCP protocol

‚úÖ **Future-Proof Architecture**: Foundation in place for Story 1.6 (Plaid integration) and Story 1.7 (Graphiti integration) 

‚úÖ **Development Velocity**: AI agents can be developed independently while sharing common financial data tools

‚úÖ **Integration Stability**: Existing application functionality completely preserved during MCP addition
