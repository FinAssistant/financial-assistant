# Story 1.5: MCP Server Foundation

## User Story

**As a** system architect,  
**I want** a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integrated into the existing FastAPI backend,  
**So that** multiple AI agents can access shared tools and data sources through a standardized interface while maintaining the current application architecture.

## Status: ✅ Completed

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing FastAPI application (`backend/app/main.py`)
- Technology: FastAPI, Python 3.11+, Docker containerization
- Follows pattern: Existing lifespan management and endpoint mounting patterns
- Touch points: Application startup/shutdown, environment configuration, test automation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. ✅ MCP server runs as integrated component within existing FastAPI application
2. ✅ AI agents can discover and execute tools via standardized MCP protocol at `/mcp` endpoint
3. ✅ Health monitoring tools provide server status and uptime information

**Security Requirements:**
4. ✅ MCP server protected by JWT authentication using existing AuthService
5. ✅ Unauthorized access properly rejected with 401 status
6. ✅ User context available to tools through authenticated JWT tokens

**Integration Requirements:**
7. ✅ Existing FastAPI endpoints (`/api/*`, `/health`) continue to work unchanged
8. ✅ New MCP functionality follows existing environment configuration pattern (MCP_ prefix)
9. ✅ Integration with existing Docker containerization maintains current deployment approach

**Quality Requirements:**
10. ✅ MCP server functionality is covered by both unit and integration tests
11. ✅ Test automation includes MCP client verification using langchain-mcp-adapters
12. ✅ Authentication flow tested for both success and failure scenarios
13. ✅ No regression in existing FastAPI functionality verified through test suite

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:** FastMCP server mounted at `/mcp` endpoint within existing FastAPI application using `app.mount()` pattern

**Existing Pattern Reference:** Follows established FastAPI lifespan management and environment configuration patterns used throughout the application

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Server Framework:** FastMCP v2.12.0 with `@mcp.tool` decorators
- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP with stateless_http=True for langchain-mcp-adapters compatibility  
- **Lifecycle Management:** Combined lifespan pattern integrating FastAPI + FastMCP startup/shutdown
- **Configuration:** MCP_ prefixed environment variables following existing conventions
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication using existing AuthService with FastMCP JWTVerifier
- **Testing:** Unit tests for business logic + comprehensive integration tests with authentication

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met - MCP server integrated and running
- [x] Integration requirements verified - Existing FastAPI functionality unchanged
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested - All tests pass
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards - Environment config, lifespan management
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new) - Unit tests + integration test with langchain-mcp-adapters
- [x] Documentation updated - Story documentation and testing instructions included

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** MCP server integration could interfere with existing FastAPI application startup/shutdown lifecycle

**Mitigation:** Used combined lifespan pattern that properly coordinates FastAPI and FastMCP lifecycles, ensuring both start and stop correctly together

**Rollback:** Remove MCP mount point and revert to previous FastAPI configuration - no database changes or breaking API modifications made

## Compatibility Verification

- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs - All existing `/api/*` endpoints unchanged  
- [x] Database changes are additive only - No database modifications required for MCP integration
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns - No frontend changes required
- [x] Performance impact is negligible - MCP server runs in same process, minimal overhead

## Technical Architecture

```
FastAPI Application (Single Process)
├── /api/* (Existing REST endpoints) ← Unchanged
├── /health (FastAPI health check) ← Unchanged  
├── /mcp (FastMCP server) ← NEW: MCP Protocol Integration
│   ├── JWT Authentication (FastMCP JWTVerifier + AuthService integration)
│   ├── Tool execution (mcp_health_check, echo, get_current_time, whoami) 
│   ├── Plaid tools (create_link_token, get_accounts - placeholders)
│   └── Compatible with langchain-mcp-adapters
└── /static (React frontend) ← Unchanged
```

## Business Value Delivered

✅ **AI Agent Platform Ready**: System can now support multiple AI agents accessing shared tools through standardized MCP protocol with secure authentication

✅ **Security-First Architecture**: JWT authentication ensures all MCP tool access is properly authorized using existing user authentication

✅ **Future-Proof Architecture**: Foundation in place for Story 1.6 (Plaid integration) with authentication already integrated

✅ **Development Velocity**: AI agents can be developed independently while sharing common financial data tools with user context

✅ **Integration Stability**: Existing application functionality completely preserved during MCP addition
