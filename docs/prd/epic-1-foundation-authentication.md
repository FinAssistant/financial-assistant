# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication

**Epic Goal:** Establish a solid technical foundation with user authentication and basic project infrastructure to validate the chosen technical approach and enable rapid development of subsequent features.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

As a developer,I want a properly configured monorepo with Python backend and React frontend,so that I can develop features efficiently with hot reloading and proper tooling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Monorepo structure with clear backend/frontend separation
    
2.  Python FastAPI backend with basic health check endpoint
    
3.  React frontend with basic routing and component structure
    
4.  Docker setup for consistent development environment
    
5.  Environment variable configuration (.env support)
    
6.  README with setup instructions
    

## Story 1.2: Basic Authentication System

As a user,I want to register and sign in with email and password,so that I can securely access the financial assistant with a simple account.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  User registration endpoint with email/password validation
    
2.  User login endpoint with credential verification
    
3.  Password hashing with secure salt (bcrypt)
    
4.  JWT token generation and validation
    
5.  Protected routes requiring authentication
    
6.  User session management (login/logout)
    
7.  Basic user profile storage (in-memory for POC)
    
8.  Password strength requirements enforcement
    

## Story 1.3: Basic UI Foundation and Navigation

As a user,I want a clean, professional interface with navigation,so that I can easily move between different sections of the financial assistant.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Responsive React layout with header, navigation, and main content area
    
2.  Navigation menu with placeholders for future features (Dashboard, Profile, etc.)
    
3.  Professional styling that builds trust (CSS framework integration)
    
4.  Loading states and basic error handling
    
5.  Mobile-responsive design foundations

## Story 1.4: Basic AI Conversation Interface

As a user,
I want a basic chat interface to communicate with the AI assistant,
so that I can start conversations and the foundation exists for future advanced AI agent features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Basic chat UI component with message input and conversation display
    
2.  Simple LangGraph Orchestrator Agent that accepts messages and provides basic responses
    
3.  AI-SDK integration for streaming conversation responses from backend to frontend
    
4.  Conversation state management in Redux store
    
5.  Existing authentication and navigation systems continue to work unchanged
    
6.  New chat interface follows existing Styled Components and responsive design patterns
    
7.  Integration with Redux store maintains current auth state behavior
    
8.  Chat interface is covered by component tests
    
9.  Conversation API is covered by backend tests
    
10. No regression in existing authentication or navigation functionality verified
    

## Story 1.5: MCP Server Foundation

As a developer,
I want a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation,
so that multiple AI agents can access shared tools and data sources through a standardized interface.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Python MCP server using the official MCP Python SDK
    
2.  Basic server setup with health check endpoints
    
3.  Integration with FastAPI backend for lifecycle management
    
4.  Configuration for tool registration and discovery
    
5.  Error handling and logging for MCP operations
    
6.  Docker configuration updated to include MCP server
    
7.  Development documentation for MCP server architecture
    

## Story 1.6: Plaid API Integration via MCP Server

As a system,
I want Plaid financial APIs accessible through the MCP server,
so that all AI agents can access bank account and transaction data through a consistent interface.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  MCP tools for Plaid Link token exchange
    
2.  MCP tools for account data retrieval
    
3.  MCP tools for transaction fetching and processing
    
4.  Secure Plaid access token management within MCP server
    
5.  Error handling for Plaid API failures through MCP interface
    
6.  Integration testing for Plaid MCP tools
    
7.  Migration of existing Plaid integration patterns to MCP
    

## Story 1.7: Graphiti Database Integration via MCP Server

As a system,
I want Graphiti graph database accessible through the MCP server,
so that AI agents can store and query contextual relationships and memory.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Graphiti database setup and configuration
    
2.  MCP tools for graph database operations (create, read, update, query)
    
3.  Schema design for user relationships and financial context
    
4.  Memory persistence for conversation context across agents
    
5.  Query tools for relationship discovery and context retrieval
    
6.  Integration testing for Graphiti MCP tools
    
7.  Development documentation for graph database schema
