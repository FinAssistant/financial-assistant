# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication

**Epic Goal:** Establish a solid technical foundation with user authentication and basic project infrastructure to validate the chosen technical approach and enable rapid development of subsequent features.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

As a developer,I want a properly configured monorepo with Python backend and React frontend,so that I can develop features efficiently with hot reloading and proper tooling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Monorepo structure with clear backend/frontend separation
    
2.  Python FastAPI backend with basic health check endpoint
    
3.  React frontend with basic routing and component structure
    
4.  Docker setup for consistent development environment
    
5.  Environment variable configuration (.env support)
    
6.  README with setup instructions
    

## Story 1.2: Google OAuth Authentication

As a user,I want to sign in with my Google account,so that I can securely access the financial assistant without creating another password.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Google OAuth integration in FastAPI backend
    
2.  React login component with Google sign-in button
    
3.  JWT token generation and validation
    
4.  Protected routes requiring authentication
    
5.  User session management (login/logout)
    
6.  Basic user profile storage (in-memory for POC)
    

## Story 1.3: Basic UI Foundation and Navigation

As a user,I want a clean, professional interface with navigation,so that I can easily move between different sections of the financial assistant.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Responsive React layout with header, navigation, and main content area
    
2.  Navigation menu with placeholders for future features (Dashboard, Profile, etc.)
    
3.  Professional styling that builds trust (CSS framework integration)
    
4.  Loading states and basic error handling
    
5.  Mobile-responsive design foundations
