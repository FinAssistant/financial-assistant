## Implementation Timeline

**Recommended Sequence:**
1. **Story 1.8 (CI/CD)**: Enables safe development (Week 1)
2. **Story 1.9 (Testing)**: Enables quality assurance (Week 1-2)
3. **Story 1.10 (Accessibility)**: Enables inclusive design (Week 2-3)
4. **Story 1.11 (Clarity)**: Enables user confidence (Week 3)

**Parallel Development**: Stories 1.10 and 1.11 can be developed in parallel with Epic 2 feature work once CI/CD and testing are established.

**Risk Mitigation**: If timeline pressure exists, Stories 1.10-1.11 can be phased in during Epic 2 development, but Stories 1.8-1.9 are non-negotiable prerequisites.

*This extension addresses the critical validation gaps that prevent safe development of advanced financial features in Epic 2.*
