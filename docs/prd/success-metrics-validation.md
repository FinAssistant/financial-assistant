# Success Metrics Validation

## User Testing Approach
- **Participants**: 5-8 target users from our primary demographic (household heads, ages 20-50)
- **Testing Method**: Live moderated sessions via screen sharing (Zoom/Google Meet)
- **Session Duration**: 15-20 minutes per participant
- **Testing Environment**: Participants use their own devices with their actual bank accounts

## Validation Process
- **Recruitment**: Target users managing multiple financial accounts (checking, savings, credit cards)
- **Session Structure**:
  1. Brief introduction (2 minutes)
  2. Live onboarding walkthrough with think-aloud protocol (10-15 minutes)
  3. Quick debrief and feedback collection (3-5 minutes)
- **Observation Focus**: 
  - Time to complete onboarding
  - Points of confusion or hesitation
  - Plaid connection success rate
  - User comfort level with AI guidance and account connection

## Success Measurement
- **Primary Metric**: Manual timing of onboarding completion (login to profile dashboard)
- **Secondary Observations**:
  - Plaid connection attempts vs successes
  - User questions or confusion points during AI conversation
  - Abandonment points (if any participants drop off)
  - Overall user confidence and satisfaction (qualitative)

## Evaluation Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Complete Epic 1 & 2 development
- **Week 3**: Recruit and conduct 5-8 user testing sessions
- **Week 4**: Analyze results and make Phase 2 go/no-go decision

## Success Thresholds for POC Validation
- **Primary**: 80% of participants complete onboarding in under 10 minutes
- **Secondary**: 95% of Plaid connection attempts succeed
- **Qualitative**: Participants express comfort with AI guidance and willingness to continue using the app

## Decision Framework
- **Proceed to Phase 2**: Meet primary + secondary thresholds with positive qualitative feedback
- **Iterate POC**: Meet primary threshold but identify clear improvement opportunities
- **Reassess Approach**: Miss primary threshold or significant user comfort concerns
