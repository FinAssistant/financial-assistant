# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create a clean, trustworthy, and approachable interface that makes complex financial data accessible and actionable. The design should feel more like a helpful financial advisor than a sterile banking application, encouraging regular engagement while maintaining professional credibility.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with high-level financial health overview, allow drilling down into detailed insights
    
*   **Guided Onboarding**: Step-by-step financial profiling that feels conversational rather than interrogating
    
*   **Dashboard-Centric**: Central hub showing financial health score, key metrics, and prioritized recommendations
    
*   **AI Personality**: Friendly but knowledgeable tone in all recommendations and explanations
    

## Core Screens and Views

*   **Onboarding Flow**: Account connection, goal setting, values capture
    
*   **Dashboard**:
    
    *   Central view showing **net cash flow**, **progress toward goals**, and **key insights**
        
    *   Visual indicators (graphs, trend lines) to help users understand patterns at a glance
        
    *   Financial health overview with actionable next steps
        
*   **Spending Analysis**: Transaction categorization, spending patterns, optimization opportunities
    
*   **Profile Management**: Goals, values, connected accounts, preferences
    
*   **Recommendations Center**:
    
    *   Every AI suggestion must be **explainable** (e.g., "We suggest cutting dining spend by 15% because it's 3Ã— higher than peers")
        
    *   Use a coaching tone ("Here's how you can save more") rather than punitive language
        
    *   Detailed expense coaching with clear reasoning and action steps
        

## Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** - Primary focus on desktop for detailed financial analysis, with mobile-optimized views for quick check-ins and notifications

## Accessibility

**WCAG AA compliance** - Essential for financial applications to ensure broad accessibility

## Branding

Professional yet approachable design that builds trust while remaining engaging. Think "financial advisor you'd recommend to a friend" rather than "intimidating bank interface."
