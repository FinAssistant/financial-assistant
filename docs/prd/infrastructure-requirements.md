# Infrastructure Requirements

**Status**: Critical - Must Address Before Feature Development  
**Priority**: P0 - Blocking Development Readiness  
**Target**: Epic 1 Foundation & Authentication

## Overview

This document defines critical infrastructure requirements identified through product validation that must be addressed before proceeding with advanced feature development (Epic 2+). These requirements ensure reliable, secure, and maintainable development practices for financial software.

## Background & Business Rationale

### Why These Requirements Are Critical

**Financial Software Constraints:**
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial applications require audit trails and quality assurance
- **Data Security**: Financial data demands robust testing and deployment processes
- **User Trust**: Financial tools must demonstrate reliability and accessibility
- **Risk Mitigation**: Infrastructure failures can result in financial losses for users

**Development Velocity Impact:**
- **Without CI/CD**: Manual deployments slow feature delivery and increase risk
- **Without Testing**: Complex AI agent features become unmaintainable
- **Without Accessibility**: Legal compliance risks and reduced market reach
- **Without Clear Responsibilities**: User onboarding failures reduce adoption

   - Environment-specific configuration management

2. **Quality Gates**
   - Automated test execution (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Code quality and security scanning
   - Build/test failures prevent deployment
   - Automated rollback on deployment failures

3. **Deployment Automation**
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach
   - Health checks and monitoring integration
   - Secrets and environment variable management
   - Database migration handling

#### Non-Functional Requirements

## User/Agent Responsibility Clarity

### Business Need
Eliminate confusion in setup process and ensure users understand their role vs. automated system capabilities.

### User Impact
- **New Users**: Clear, confident onboarding experience
- **Existing Users**: Understanding of system capabilities and limitations
- **Support Team**: Reduced support tickets and user confusion

### Functional Requirements

#### Responsibility Matrix
1. **User Responsibilities**
