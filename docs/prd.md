User Interface Design Goals
---------------------------

### Overall UX Vision

Create a clean, trustworthy, and approachable interface that makes complex financial data accessible and actionable. The design should feel more like a helpful financial advisor than a sterile banking application, encouraging regular engagement while maintaining professional credibility.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with high-level financial health overview, allow drilling down into detailed insights
    
*   **Guided Onboarding**: Step-by-step financial profiling that feels conversational rather than interrogating
    
*   **Dashboard-Centric**: Central hub showing financial health score, key metrics, and prioritized recommendations
    
*   **AI Personality**: Friendly but knowledgeable tone in all recommendations and explanations
    

### Core Screens and Views

*   **Onboarding Flow**: Account connection, goal setting, values capture
    
*   **Dashboard**:
    
    *   Central view showing **net cash flow**, **progress toward goals**, and **key insights**
        
    *   Visual indicators (graphs, trend lines) to help users understand patterns at a glance
        
    *   Financial health overview with actionable next steps
        
*   **Spending Analysis**: Transaction categorization, spending patterns, optimization opportunities
    
*   **Profile Management**: Goals, values, connected accounts, preferences
    
*   **Recommendations Center**:
    
    *   Every AI suggestion must be **explainable** (e.g., "We suggest cutting dining spend by 15% because it's 3Ã— higher than peers")
        
    *   Use a coaching tone ("Here's how you can save more") rather than punitive language
        
    *   Detailed expense coaching with clear reasoning and action steps
        

### Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** - Primary focus on desktop for detailed financial analysis, with mobile-optimized views for quick check-ins and notifications

### Accessibility

**WCAG AA compliance** - Essential for financial applications to ensure broad accessibility

### Branding

Professional yet approachable design that builds trust while remaining engaging. Think "financial advisor you'd recommend to a friend" rather than "intimidating bank interface."

## Success Metrics Validation

### User Testing Approach
- **Participants**: 5-8 target users from our primary demographic (household heads, ages 20-50)
- **Testing Method**: Live moderated sessions via screen sharing (Zoom/Google Meet)
- **Session Duration**: 15-20 minutes per participant
- **Testing Environment**: Participants use their own devices with their actual bank accounts

### Validation Process
- **Recruitment**: Target users managing multiple financial accounts (checking, savings, credit cards)
- **Session Structure**:
  1. Brief introduction (2 minutes)
  2. Live onboarding walkthrough with think-aloud protocol (10-15 minutes)
  3. Quick debrief and feedback collection (3-5 minutes)
- **Observation Focus**: 
  - Time to complete onboarding
  - Points of confusion or hesitation
  - Plaid connection success rate
  - User comfort level with AI guidance and account connection

### Success Measurement
- **Primary Metric**: Manual timing of onboarding completion (login to profile dashboard)
- **Secondary Observations**:
  - Plaid connection attempts vs successes
  - User questions or confusion points during AI conversation
  - Abandonment points (if any participants drop off)
  - Overall user confidence and satisfaction (qualitative)

### Evaluation Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Complete Epic 1 & 2 development
- **Week 3**: Recruit and conduct 5-8 user testing sessions
- **Week 4**: Analyze results and make Phase 2 go/no-go decision

### Success Thresholds for POC Validation
- **Primary**: 80% of participants complete onboarding in under 10 minutes
- **Secondary**: 95% of Plaid connection attempts succeed
- **Qualitative**: Participants express comfort with AI guidance and willingness to continue using the app

### Decision Framework
- **Proceed to Phase 2**: Meet primary + secondary thresholds with positive qualitative feedback
- **Iterate POC**: Meet primary threshold but identify clear improvement opportunities
- **Reassess Approach**: Miss primary threshold or significant user comfort concerns
