# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the AI Financial Assistant POC, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach streamlines development for the modern fullstack application where frontend state management, AI conversations, and financial data processing are tightly integrated.

## Starter Template Assessment

Based on your requirements analysis:
**Decision**: Custom setup recommended over starter templates
**Rationale**: 
- Financial applications require specific security configurations
- LangGraph + Plaid integration needs custom backend architecture  
- Redux + AI-SDK frontend patterns not available in standard templates
- POC scope benefits from minimal, focused setup
