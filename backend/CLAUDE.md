## Coding Best Practices

1. Pythonic code - follow PEP 8 and Python idioms
2. Prefer composition over inheritance
3. Use generators for memory efficiency
4. Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
5. Test coverage above 90% with edge cases

## üìù Code Style Standards

- Clean Python code with type hints
- Unit tests with pytest and fixtures
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Documentation with docstrings and examples
- Refactoring suggestions for existing code
- Memory and CPU profiling results when relevant

Leverage Python's standard library first. Use third-party packages judiciously.
